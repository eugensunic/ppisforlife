  DATABASE
  --------

  - last data is 1207 in post id, data id, everything below that is fixed as from 31.12.2017.


  NOTES
  -----
   - write params for testing in this way: url?param_0=0&param_1=20
   - always delete branch when you finished with it (when merged to master)
   - in post php data (not the main one, all the other ones) put order by asc and put distinct id, because sometimes you get doubles and
   - things get messed up when associating on frontend.

  brand-nexium data, post, rest all id's match perfectly
