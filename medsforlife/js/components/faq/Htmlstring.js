    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this page you can find almost
      <b>"all"</b> the questions you have asked yourself about PPIs. Answers were collected from trusted websites and are
      <b>very accurate</b>. The majority of answers are linked to their original source (some answers have multiple sources),
      the other answers are given by the author of the app
      and are based on his information gathering for the last 3 years about the PPIs. Some questions
      do not have answers because they haven’t been found anywhere on the Internet. Remember, the vast majority of answers
      are accurate and those who do not have or have little knowledge about their condition and this drug or would like
      to learn more should learn from them.</p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key for every disease and its treatment in the patient perspective is to gain as much knowledge as
      possible. Once you get familiar with your condition and therapy you can then manage your lifestyle more efficiently.
      Upper abdominal disease (stomach, esophagus) can be controlled with natural treatments, drugs, diet, surgery, psychological
      treatment etc. The more we know, the better it gets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knowledge allows us to talk more efficiently with doctors (GPs, specialist) and ask the most important
      questions that we still don’t know, likewise we can participate in a much better way on forums/discussion groups and
      ask more concise questions.

          PPIs are an efficacious and safe drug class. They offer relief to patients in a patient-centered healthcare system. Unfortunately,
          these agents do potentially have some long-term consequences from continued use, including malabsorption issues
          and increased risk of infections. The pharmacist can be an advocate for the patient in the hospital system
          or in the community by understanding these risks and fostering patient-centered care by empowering a well-informed
          patient in healthcare decisions.

          PPIs stop cells in the lining of the stomach producing too much acid. They are called 'proton pump inhibitors' because they
          work by blocking (inhibiting) a chemical system called the hydrogen-potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme
          system (otherwise known as the 'proton pump'). This chemical system is found in the cells in the stomach lining
          that make stomach acid. The proton pump is the terminal stage in gastric acid secretion, being directly responsible
          for secreting H+ ions into the gastric lumen, making it an ideal target for inhibiting acid secretion.

          If one of your PPI does not work, you should try another PPI brand and so on until you find the “perfect” one. Also try H2
          blockers. If you haven’t managed your diet then do so. Eliminate certain foods (lactose, gluten, carbs, fizzy
          drinks, junk food etc.) and see if that helps. If none of this helps then visit your MD. The last resort would
          be an esophageal surgery (Nissen fundoplication and other related procedures). Make sure you try everything
          else before surgery.

          Proton pump inhibitors work best when they are taken 30 minutes before your first meal of the day (morning meal). If taking

          There isn’t the best brand in terms of PPIs. All PPI brands work the same, by inhibiting the little pumps in our stomach
          and therefore allowing our stomach/esophagus to heal over time. Other types of PPIs have been compared to omeprazole
          (the first PPI type) and no one showed any significant difference in terms of being the best. The newer PPI
          (esomeprazole-nexium) also does not show any significant difference compared to omeprazole (prilosec). Dexlansoprazole
          which was approved by the FDA in 2009 (Kapidex, Dexilant). Showed a little advatanges when compared to esomeprazole
          but again, no significant difference.

          As often said, no drug is 100% safe. That doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t take one if you need it. But you should continually
          weigh the risks and benefits. </br>
          Many people take PPIs. People often take PPIs every day for years. This makes sense if you have a chronic problem with stomach
          acid, a severe case of Barrett’s esophagus, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome etc., but the occasional case of mild
          heartburn does not need to be treated with a PPI. </br>

          If you have a prescription for a PPI, you and your doctor should review the reasons for it periodically to make sure they’re
          still valid. If you do need that prescription and many people do it should be for the lowest effective dose.

          Because PPIs give rise to profound and long-lasting elevation of intragastric pH, it is not surprising that they interfere
          with the absorption of concurrent medications. PPIs have been shown to reduce the bioavailability of many clinically
          relevant drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, atazanavir) by 50% or more compared with the control values. Omeprazole
          was associated with 30% and 10% reductions in systemic clearance of diazepam and phenytoin. Clinical trials
          have raised concerns about possible interactions between PPIs and clopidogrel. It has been suggested that therapy
          consisting of clopidogrel and aspirin may attenuate the anti-aggregation effects of those medications and augment
          the risk of cardiovascular ischemic events.

          A proton pump is an integral membrane protein that is capable of moving protons across a biological membrane. In cell respiration.
          The proton pump uses energy to transport protons from the matrix of the mitochondrion to the inter-membrane
          space. The proton pump does not create energy, but forms a gradient that stores energy for later use. In addition
          to proton pumps in mitochondria, humans have a gastric hydrogen potassium ATPase or H+/K+ ATPase that functions
          as the proton pump of the stomach, primarily responsible for making the stomach acidic.

          The popular over-the-counter and prescription acid-blocking drugs proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) do not appear to increase
          risk of birth defects when taken during the first trimester of pregnancy, a study shows.
          <p></p>
          In the study, 2.6% of more than 840,000 live births occurring in Denmark from January 1996 through September 2008 involved
          major birth defects. The study showed that 3.4% of 5,082 infants whose mothers took PPIs during the four weeks
          before conception through first trimester were diagnosed with a major birth defect. By contrast, 2.6% of 835,886
          infants whose moms did not take these acid-reducing drugs during the same time period were diagnosed with a
          major birth defect.
          </p>
          </p>
          The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The researchers did an analysis of the study data on PPI use
          limited to the time period during the first trimester of pregnancy. Statistically speaking, there was no significant
          increased risk of birth defects seen among children of women who took PPIs -- including Aciphex, Nexium, Prevacid,
          Prilosec, and Protonix -- during their first trimester of pregnancy compared with women who did not take these
          drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy.

          “We found no significant association between the use of PPIs during the first trimester of pregnancy and the risk of major

          PPIs became generic and were then available over the counter. However, there are still many areas of unmet
          need in GERDs, so new therapies are needed. Current compounds under development include improved PPIs (dexlansoprazole,
          tenatoprazole-clinical trial, ilaprazole-clinical trial), TLESR reducers, esophageal-specific pain modulators,
          and mucosal protectants.

          I've read on forums that PPIs are not toxic but a doctor (David Jacobson) at Medscape said (year 2017) that they are probably
          more harmful then steroids (gaining quite a few up votes on his comment). Quote: “This class of medication
          is probably more dangerous than steroids, but most docs dispense it like Pez. Cellular modifying drugs should
          be used as a last resort”. Still, if they are FDA approved and used by millions of patients from all around
          the world, then PPI should be quite safe.

        <div class="card-block">
          A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach pushes up through your diaphragm into your chest region.
          <p></p>
          This condition mostly occurs in people who are over 50 years of age. It affects up to 60 percent of people by the time they
          reach 60, according to the Esophageal Cancer Awareness Association.
          <p></p>
          The exact cause of many hiatal hernias is unknown. In some people, injury or other damage may weaken muscle tissue. This
          makes it possible for your stomach to push through your diaphragm. Another cause is putting too much pressure
          (constantly) on the muscles around your stomach. This can happen when you:
          <ul>
            <li>cough</li>
            <li>vomit</li>
            <li>strain during bowel movements</li>
            <li>lift heavy objects</li>
          </ul>
          Some people are also born with an abnormally large hiatus. This makes it easier for the stomach to move through it. Factors
          that can increase your likelihood of developing a hiatal hernia are:
          <ul>
            <li>obesity</li>
            <li>aging</li>
            <li>smoking</li>
          </ul>
          Types of hiatal hernia:
          <b>slided</b>-common and
          <b>fixed</b>-uncommon.

          In some cases, a paraesophageal hernia may slide into the chest and become trapped and unable to slide back into the abdomen.
          If this happens, there is a danger that the trapped hernia may die because its blood supply is cut off (strangulated).
          Symptoms of a strangulated hiatal hernia include sudden severe chest pain and difficulty swallowing. Such situation
          requires immediate medical treatment.

          Bile reflux occurs when bile which is a digestive liquid produced in your liver backs up (refluxes) into your stomach and
          the tube that connects your mouth and stomach (esophagus). Bile reflux may come with acid reflux, but they
          are 2 separate conditions. Whether bile is important in reflux is controversial. Bile is often a suspected
          cause of reflux when people respond incompletely or not at all to acid supressing drugs.
          <p></p>
          Unlike acid reflux, bile reflux usually can't be completely controlled by changes in diet or lifestyle. Treatment involves
          medications or, in severe cases, surgery.
          <p></p>
          Bile and acid reflux are both needed for formation of Barrett’s esophagus.

          Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is a rare condition in which 1 or more tumors form in your pancreas or the upper part of your
          small intestine (duodenum). These tumors, called gastrinomas, secrete large amounts of the hormone gastrin,
          which causes your stomach to produce too much acid. The excess acid causes peptic ulcers, as well as diarrhea
          and other symptoms.
          <p></p>
          Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is rare. The disease may occur at any time in life, but people are usually diagnosed between
          ages 20 and 50. Medications to reduce stomach acid (PPIs) and heal the ulcers is the standard treatment for
          this condition.

          Acute gastritis is a sudden inflammation of the stomach lining often caused by: H. pylori, NSAID or corticosteroid usage,
          excessive alcohol consumption or other.

          Chronic gastritis represents chronic/long lasting inflammation of the stomach lining caused by: longterm NSAID or corticosteroids

          <p></p>
          Atrophic gastritis is a chronic inflammation of the stomach mucosa, where gastric glandular cells get replaced by intestinal
          and fibrous tissues. It is caused by: long-term H. pylori infection or can appear as autoimmune disease.

          Erosive lining in general means that you have a small internal bleeding inside your esophagus/stomach. After the mucosa breaks,
          the stomach acid can easily digest your lining and therefore usually causes small amounts of blood visible
          on the lining. If left untreated, the erosive gastritis usually progresses to ulcers or even more bleeding
          which can be fatal.

          For such condition, PPIs are prescribed for 4-8 weeks daily (dosage depends on the severity of the erosions). Althought this

          In conclusion, our results suggest that PPI therapy is associated with an approximately 2 times increased risk of developing
          pneumonia possibly as a result of the endogenous oropharyngeal flora. In particular we found a significantly
          increased association between PPI use and S. pneumoniae pneumonia. It should be reminded that, in line with
          previous observational studies, the association between PPI use and adverse events may be due to confounding,
          with PPI use more of a marker for, than a cause of, higher rates of CAP due to S. pneumoniae. Therefore further
          studies are required to delineate the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms relating PPI usage to respiratory infection.

          Let’s says something about absorption first.
          <p></p>
          <b>Magnesium:</b> typical magnesium absorption involves: 40% of magnesium intake absorbed in the small intestine
          5% absorbed in the large intestine 55% leaving the body as waste
          <p></p>
          <b>Calcium</b> is absorbed in the mammalian small intestine by two general mechanisms: a transcellular active
          transport process, located largely in the duodenum and upper jejunum; and a paracellular, passive process that
          functions throughout the length of the intestine
          <p></p>
          <b>Vitamin B12</b> is readily absorbed in the last part of the small intestine (ileum), which leads to the large
          intestine. However, to be absorbed, the vitamin must combine with intrinsic factor, a protein produced in the
          stomach.
          <p></p>
          <b>Iron:</b> the portion of the small intestine called the duodenum is the chief area where iron absorption takes
          place. There may be a second minor absorption site near the end of the small intestinal tract. Once iron is
          absorbed it is carried (transported) by a protein called transferrin.
          <p></p>
          All of the vitamin, minerals deficiencies (mentioned above) have been associated with the use of PPIs in some patients, especially
          patients who have been on higher PPI dosages for a prolonged period of time. Patient on a long-term PPI therapy
          should get their blood sample checked for Mg, Ca, B12, Fe and if they are low on any of this vitamin, minerals
          they should increase their intake and/or change the dosage, drug for some period of time but the first thing
          to do is to talk to your Doctor.

          Researchers are not clear on how PPI use might raise dementia risk. Evidence suggests some PPIs may cross the blood–brain
          barrier and interact with brain enzymes and, in mice, may increase beta amyloid levels in the brain. Although
          the current study did not include vitamin B12 levels, other research has linked PPI use to vitamin B12 deficiency,
          which has been shown to be associated with cognitive decline, Dr Haenisch noted.
          <p></p>
          The recent study used data from a German health insurance provider of people aged 75 years or older to show that patients
          who had used PPIs were 44 percent more likely to develop dementia. The same group reported similar results
          in an earlier study on a different set of elderly Germans. This consistency is marred, however, by a third
          study from another group of German scientists reporting that the use of PPIs is associated with a 7 percent
          lower risk of dementia. All of these studies were observational, which makes it hard to draw conclusions. In
          the recent study, Germans who took PPIs were also more likely to have depression, cardiovascular disease, and
          polypharmacy (i.e., they were prescribed a lot of drugs). These conditions are all associated with a higher
          risk of dementia. While the scientists tried to control for these risks in their analysis, it is difficult
          to be sure that they succeeded without more studies to replicate their results and to look for extra clues
          in the data like a dose-response relationship, where higher doses of the drugs relate to a higher risk.

          online January 11 in JAMA Internal Medicine. The authors suggest the widely used drugs might be part of the
          reason CKD prevalence has risen faster than would be expected from the trends in known CKD risk factors, such
          as diabetes mellitus and hypertension.
          <p></p>
          PPI treatment is known to increase the risk for acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and CKD. However, whether PPI use is tied
          to a greater risk for chronic kidney damage in the absence of an earlier episode of acute kidney injury (AKI)
          has been unclear.
          <p></p>
          The possible mechanisms tying PPI use with chronic renal damage are also still unclear

          The junction of the squamous epithelium of the esophagus and the gastric columnar epithelium occurs at the junction of the
          esophagus and stomach where the lower esophageal sphincter is located. The common border (interface) of these
          two linings is often referred to as the
          <b>Z line</b>, because when examined during an endoscopy, it has a zig zag appearance.

          If biopsies are taken from patients with GERD who have a normal appearing Z line (no visible evidence of Barrett's esophagus),
          up to 30% will show the same intestinal type metaplasia as those that are seen in Barrett's esophagus. The
          presence of metaplasia on a routine biopsy of a normal appearing Z line in GERD should not lead to any change
          in management.

          Patients with Barrett’s esophagus should be enrolled in a surveillance program to look for signs of abnormal tissue (dysplasia)
          or cancer. This is a very slow growing cancer and endoscopies are usually done every 3 years. Patients with
          esophagitis should have a repeat endoscopy to demonstrate healing. Occasionally, when the esophagitis is healed,
          one can see Barrett’s esophagus. It is extremely uncommon to develop Barrett’s esophagus and then develop esophageal
          cancer.
          <p></p>
          There is a 0.5-1% that Barrett’s will turn into cancer.

          They protect it by drastically reducing stomach acid and creating an environment with very little stomach acid means that
          the stomach lining can heal over time because there isn’t a corrosive substance which damages it anymore (stomach
          acid).
          <p></p>
          The same goes for the esophagus lining. GERD may still be present but since the stomach acid has dropped in the stomach the
          reflux becomes less corrosive. Therefore the esophagus heals over time.

          <b>Neoplasia:</b> neoplasia of the stomach-esophagus lining means cancer and it is not reversible like metaplasia

          People often think that GERD = acid reflux = heartburn. In one way we can say that this is true. Heartburn is the key symptom
          here. GERD and acid reflux are here because of heartburn happening.
          <p></p>
          Acid reflux can be described as “occasional heartburn”. The main reason is overeating as well as bad diet and trigger foods,
          lifestyle often can fix acid reflux.
          <p></p>
          GERD on the other hand is a chronic condition where acid gets into your esophagus more often. Several times a week or daily.
          <p></p>
          GERD often needs chronic drugs treatment. If not treated things can get worse and although rare, cancer of the esophagus
          can form which such condition.

          As with everything else, if you have occasional stomach pain (let’s say once or twice month), if you get stomach pain from
          overeating or binge drinking then you hardly need to visit your doctor. However if you have a persistent stomach
          pain and other symptoms accompanying the pain for longer than 1 week or if this is repeating itself every month
          or so, then you should definitely visit a doctor.
          <p></p>
          You can always try to manage your condition with diet or eliminating certain foods when having often stomach pain/discomfort.
          If that doesn’t help then you know that something else is going on which doesn’t mean that it’s something serious
          but needs medical evaluation.
          <p></p>
          Of course, if you have unbearable stomach pain followed by other symptoms, then you should visit the emergency room.

          Gastrin is a hormone the stomach produces which then stimulates the release of gastric acid when you eat. It breaks down
          protein in the food and kills bacteria which is in the food. In this way the gut is being protected from infection.
          <p></p>
          High levels of gastrin cells and circulating gastrin hormone can also occur if the pH of the stomach is too high (the stomach
          is low in acid).
          <p></p>
          Low gastrin levels are rare. When low levels do occur, the condition can increase the risk of infection in the digestive
          system, and also limits the stomach's ability to absorb nutrients.

          Peristalsis is a series of wave-like muscle contractions that moves food to different processing stations in the digestive

          motions of the smooth muscle in the esophagus carry the food to the stomach, where it is churned into a liquid
          mixture called chyme.

          GERD can affect the sinuses. This is a matter of increasing interest to researchers.A number of studies make a very plausible
          connection between GERD and chronic sinusitis.
          <p></p>
          Although the connection between acid reflux and CRS (chronic rhino sinusitis) isn’t well understood, there are several possible
          reasons for the increased risk of CRS in acid reflux patients. One is that exposure to acid gastric fluids
          could injure the lining of the nasal cavities, provoking a series of immune responses such as inflammation
          and allowing infection. They could also irritate sympathetic nerves in the respiratory system, causing nasal
          congestion, excessive nasal secretions and continuous post nasal drainage. LRS may also contribute to infection
          of the upper airways by bacteria from the intestinal tract.

          GERD affects between 18% and 28% of the adult U.S. population (children, teenagers not included). That means between 42 million
          and 64 million adults in the U.S. suffer from GERD.
          <p></p>
          Europeans, Middle Easterners and South Americans also have high rates: in Europe, between 9% and 26% of the adult population
          meets the criteria to be diagnosed with GERD, as do up to 33% of adults in the Middle East and 23% of adults
          living in South America. Meanwhile, the rate of GERD in East Asian adults is only around 2% to 8%, and in Australian
          adults it's 12%.

          Some people with LPR do have heartburn. Some people with LPR don't have heartburn very often, but actually about half the
          people who have LPR never have any heartburn at all. This is because the material that refluxes does not stay
          in the esophagus for very long. In other words, the acid does not have enough time to irritate the esophagus
          and cause heartburn.

          came Lansoprazole being launched in Europe in 1991 and the US in 1995. Pantoprazole was the third PPI and was
          introduced to the German market in 1994 after 7 years of clinical trials. Then came Rabeprazole which is a
          novel benzimidazole compound on market, since 1999 in USA. It is similar to lansoprazole. After that came esomeprazole

            Bleeding in the upper digestive tract including the esophagus, stomach and upper portion of the small intestine
            is the most worrisome cause of black stools. The blood causes the stool to turn black as it works its way
            from the upper to the lower intestine before being passed during a bowel movement. Bleeding in the lower
            digestive track usually causes red or maroon stools, or bloody streaks or clots in the fecal matter rather
            than black stool. It takes a significant amount of bleeding -- usually at least 100 milliliters or 0.4 cups
            -- from the upper digestive tract to cause black stools. Some of the possible causes of this type of upper
            digestive tract bleeding include:
            <p></p>
          So, black stools could indicate upper GI bleeding, whereas bright red stool indicates lower GI bleeding.

          Before the discovery of H. Pylori. Doctors thought that stress was the cause of ulcers. After the discovery of the bacteria,
          things have changed. The today thought is that stress can only make ulcers worse but does not cause them.
          <p></p>
          „Stress, especially prolonged stress, can have an effect on stomach acid production. While this alone can cause ulcers in
          some cases, most of the time the bacterial infection or use of anti-inflammatory drugs in the stomach is required.
          “
          <p></p>
          “Stress won't cause stomach ulcers, but it can make them worse,” says Dr. David Graham, professor of medicine and molecular
          virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine. “Stress causes the body to produce higher amounts
          of acid, which can irritate preexisting ulcers.”

          A drug interaction is a reaction between two (or more) drugs or between a drug and a food or beverage. Taking
            a drug while having certain medical conditions can also cause a drug interaction. For example, taking a nasal
            decongestant if you have high blood pressure may cause an unwanted reaction. A drug interaction can decrease
            or increase the action of a drug or cause unwanted side effects.<p></p>

            Drug interactions occur when one drug alters the pharmacological effect of another drug. The pharmacological
            effect of one or both drugs may be increased or decreased, or a new and unanticipated adverse effect may
            be produced. Drug interactions may result from pharmacokinetic interactions (absorption, distribution, metabolism,
            and excretion) or from interactions at drug receptors.

        <div class="card-block">
          Alcohol can irritate the lining of the stomach and cause excess production of acid. This may lead to ulcers and gastritis,
          and it can also aggravate GERD. In addition, alcohol can cause clumping of red blood cells, which may clog
          blood vessels, leading to bleeding, hemorrhaging and possibly to death.
          <p></p>
          Although drinking alcohol is not contraindicated when using lansoprazole (PPI), caution is advised. Side effects from taking
          lansoprazole include drowsiness and dizziness, which may be aggravated by NSAIDs. These medications may cause
          stomach ulcers and bleeding, which might be exacerbated by the consumption of alcohol. Certain medical conditions
          may be made worse if you drink alcohol while taking lansoprazole. If you have an alcohol problem, are suffering
          from dehydration, or have low blood sodium levels, your doctor may advise you to avoid drinking alcohol while
          taking this medication.

          If you are taking a PPI then you should definitely find a way how to reduce your smoking passion. Smoking not only increases
          stomach acid but also relaxes the valve (sphincter) because of the nicotine substance which closes after the
          food enters your stomach and therefore prevents reflux. The opening/closing sphincter is actually the main
          culprit for GERD. If it is really hard for you to stop smoking then at least stop smoking during the ongoing
          PPI therapy usually 4-8 weeks. Smoking will definitely extend the healing of your stomach/esophagus lining.

          A study tested a LCHF (low carbs high fiber) diet on a few people with this problem, and they got significantly better. Even
          the pH in their esophagus improved.
          <p></p>
          Another slightly larger, study has tested this idea again. Not only does it find that carbohydrates, sugar and the glycemic
          load of the diet was associated with reflux disease. They also test what happens when the participants goes
          on a lower carb diet. The result indicates that all women in the study were able to get off their reflux (GERD)
          medications.
          <p></p>
          The results from researchers at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, published in the August 2006 issue of "Digestive
          Diseases and Sciences," which showed that a carb-restricted diet helped reduce the amount of time acid was
          present in the esophagus of the participants in addition to improving most of the pain and other symptoms related
          to their acid reflux. The diet used in this study was not completely carb-free because it included 20 grams
          of carbs from nonstarchy vegetables daily, but eliminated grains, starchy vegetables, fruits and sugar.
          <p></p>
          The exact mechanism for the effectiveness of low-carb or carb-free diets in the management of acid reflux has yet to be determined.
          if you are overweight or obese, a low-carb diet can help you lose weight, which can reduce the pressure on
          your stomach and prevent acid reflux from occurring. However, the positive results found in the UNC study with
          a very low-carb diet appeared within less than a week, indicates that a carbohydrate-restricted diet may alleviate
          acid reflux in more than one way.

          An article published in September 2011 issue of Diseases of Esophagus noted how a number of published studies have shown
          that gluten-free diet can efficiently control esophageal symptoms and help prevent recurrence. In one study
          from 2009, Italian researchers found that gluten-intolerant people on a gluten-free diet responded more favorably
          to GERD treatment with medication. They also found that fewer gluten-free dieters experienced a recurrence
          of their GERD symptoms, compared with the control group. The researchers concluded that a gluten-free diet
          could help reduce GERD symptoms and prevent damaging acid reflux in those with celiac disease.
          <p></p>
          Most experts don’t believe that gluten intolerance leads to GERD, or has any connection to GERD. "Eliminating gluten for
          reflux doesn't make sense because there's no association for reflux," says Michael Vaezi, MD, PhD, clinical
          director of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology and director of the Center for Esophageal Motility
          Disorders at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn.

          is a big chance that your condition will return. The best thing to do is to go on a diet to get the maximum
          effective and rapid healing process. The key is to find the trigger foods. You will find these by eating and
          seeing what food, drink doesn’t go well on your stomach, oesophagus. If you have a chronic condition it would
          be wise to stay on a lifetime diet, avoiding smoking and heavy alcohol use. This doesn’t mean that you can‘t
          eat unhealthy food once in a while. It means that you should be aware of you chronic condition and treat it

        You may lift weights and not realize you have a hiatal hernia if you don't develop the main symptom of acid
          reflux. Upon discovery of a hernia, your doctor may restrict your weightlifting activities if he thinks the
          sport is interfering with your health. Because excess pressure in the abdominal region can cause a hernia
          to worsen, you may need to work with lighter weights, or switch to hand weights until you've had your hernia

          They work immediately on excess acid. They do not prevent excess acid occurring. These are drugs that neutralise the acid.
          Most commonly they are made of chalk, calcium carbonate. Examples are Tums or Rennie.

          Gaviscon is the brand name of the white milky liquid that floats on the stomach contents as oil floats on water to reduce
          the possibility of reflux whilst also providing a temporary protective film to the lower oesophagus and neutralising
          the acid with an antacid component. (Some generic versions are now available.)
          <p></p>
          <u>H2 blockers</u>
          <p></p>
          Histamine H2 Receptor Antagonists work to block the (histamine H2) signals that tell the stomach to produce acid. (N.B. This
          is not the same as an antihistamine which blocks histamine H1). The most common is Ranitidine, brand name Zantac
          but others are available as shown below. These work proactively to reduce the amount of acid rather than being
          an instant antacid. Often prescribed to be taken in the evening to reduce nighttime reflux of acid.

          A lot of data has been collected from patients in the hospital who are on PPIs. PPIs have been associated with disease such
          as: ckd, nephritis, osteoporosis, certain infections, dementia, heart problems etc. Up to this date no study
          can confirm if PPIs really causes any of the condition above but correlation has proven positive. Remember
          correlation does not equal causation.
          <p></p>
          In the last 2 years a lot has been written about PPIs and their negative impact on kidneys. Every once in a while a new study
          comes which heavily correlates PPIs with nephritis and CKD at the end. No one knows for certain what could
          be the mechanism of PPIs which would cause an impact on kidneys or whether PPIs really do some damage on them.
          <p></p>
          Nevertheless, PPIs are one of the drugs which are being heavily discussed in the media because of 2 things. They are used
          by millions throughout the globe and there is a negative trend in terms of developing GERD
          and stomach problems which shows that there will be more and more people who will develop gastroesophageal
          diseases in the upcoming future not to mention that the media anxiously waits for “bad news” to write sensation
          articles.

          PPIs do not directly affect the immune system but by decreasing the stomach acid you might become vulnerable to certain bacteria’s
          which the immune system has to eliminate then. You can think of the stomach acid as the first line of defence
          against bacteria’s. Our stomach acid is so powerful that it destroys the bacteria which enters your digestive
          system. Lack of stomach acid allows the bacteria to move further and then the immune system has to get rid
          of it. This is why doctors say to remain on the lowest effective dose.

          Patients often get scared about this, especially when they have been on this drug for years. The reason why this is written
          is because you should talk to your doctor after you are using the drug more than 14 days and review your condition
          with him. OTC drugs should not be taken longterm, they are here to give you temporary relief. If the problems

          Historically, heart burn symptoms were rarely seen in the developing world. For example, in a review of 36 published studies,
          the risk of having acid reflux symptoms in China was less than 5% in any given week. The risk of acid reflux
          is also extremely low in Africa.
          <p></p>
          The fact that acid reflux is rarely seen in the developing world is reason for hope. It suggests that there is something
          about the American lifestyle which contributes to this condition. Based on these studies, if we can change
          our lifestyles then most people can avoid acid reflux.

           Anxiety is not your fault.
           <p></p>
          Psychological research is beginning to understand what causes anxiety (if we understand the cause, we can treat
            anxiety by getting to the root of the problem) however, thus far researchers haven’t been able to definitively
            pinpoint exact causes. That said, we do know some things:
            <p></p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Genetic Disposition for Anxiety</li>
            <li>Someone’s environment stress level, lifestyle, etc. can contribute to anxiety.</li>
            <li>Neurology, things happening in
              the brain, play a role.</li>
            <li>Learned behaviors can make someone anxious (For example, if a parent responds to the world in an anxious
              fashion, a child can learn anxious patterns. This does not mean, though, that parents cause anxiety in
              their kids. Modeling a behavior might be a contributing factor in anxiety’s development, but it’s not a
              single-handed cause.)</li>
            <li>Psychological factors can increase anxiety, particularly unhealthy thought patterns
            </li>
          </ol>
           <p></p>
          Anxiety and stress are not the same. Anxiety is much more than stress. Even if you experience stress on a daily
            basis (we all do today) this doesn't mean you are suffering from anxiety.

          Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a type of bacteria which causes infection in the stomach. It is found in about 2/3 of
          the world's population. It may be spread by unclean food and water, but researchers aren't sure.
          <p></p>
          The mode of transmission of helicobacter is unknown but studies show that people with helicobacter infections may have it
          also in their saliva. So, in this study, 75% had helicobacter identified by molecular Probes. This has lead
          to some people saying that transmission by saliva is common.

          <b>Bleeding</b> which may occur if a stomach polyp is removed or a biopsy is taken.
          <br/>
          <b>Infections</b>: most endoscopies consist of an examination and biopsy, and risk of infection is low. The risk

          <b>Tearing of the gastrointestinal tract</b> occurs in an estimated 1 of every 2,500 to 11,000 diagnostic upper

          Risk can be reduced further by following exactly the commands from the doctor during the procedure (without anaesthesia)

          Your doctor may recommend esophageal manometry if you experience symptoms that could be related to an esophageal disorder.
          Esophageal manometry provides information about the movement (motility) of food through the esophagus and into
          the stomach. The test measures how well the circular bands of muscle (sphincters) at the top and bottom of
          your esophagus open and close, as well as the pressure, strength and pattern of the wave of esophageal muscle
          contractions that moves food along.

          Vagotomy is a surgical procedure for peptic ulcer diseases which involves removing parts of the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve
          is used to regulate the heartbeat and the muscle movement necessary to keep you breathing. This nerve also
          regulates the chemical levels in the digestive system so that the intestines can process food and keep track
          of what types of nutrients are being gained from the food that is taken in. Vagotomy was once commonly performed
          to treat and prevent ulcer diseases. However, with the availability of excellent acid secretion control with
          H2 receptor antagonists, such as cimetidine, ranitidine, and famotidine, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs),
          such as pantoprazole, rabeprazole, omeprazole, and lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole etc. the need for surgical
          management of peptic ulcer disease has greatly decreased.

          During fundoplication surgery, the upper curve of the stomach (the fundus) is wrapped around the esophagus camera.gif and
          sewn into place so that the lower portion of the esophagus passes through a small tunnel of stomach muscle.
          This surgery strengthens the valve between the esophagus and stomach (lower esophageal sphincter), which stops
          acid from backing up into the esophagus as easily. This allows the esophagus to heal.
          <p></p>
          If open surgery (which requires a large incision) is done, you will most likely spend several days in the hospital. A general
          anesthetic is used, which means you sleep through the operation. After open surgery, you may need 4 to 6 weeks
          to get back to work or your normal routine. If the laparoscopic method is used, you will most likely be in
          the hospital for only 2 to 3 days. A general anesthetic is used. You will have less pain after surgery, because
          there is no large incision to heal. After laparoscopic surgery, most people can go back to work or their normal
          routine in about 2 to 3 weeks, depending on their work. After either surgery, you may need to change the way
          you eat. You may need to eat only soft foods until the surgery heals. And you should chew food thoroughly and
          eat more slowly to give the food time to go down the esophagus.

          Stretta is a minimally invasive endoscopic procedure for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that delivers
          radiofrequency energy in the form of electromagnetic waves through electrodes at the end of a catheter to the
          lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the gastric cardia - the region of the stomach just below the LES. The
          energy heats the tissue, ultimately causing it to swell and stiffen; the way this works was not understood
          as of 2015, but it was thought that perhaps the heat causes local inflammation, collagen deposition and muscular
          thickening of the LES and that it may disrupt the nerves there. Its relative safety and efficacy are controversial,
          with the American College of Gastroenterology recommending against its use in 2013, and in the same year the
          Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) giving it a strong recommendation for

            population and the impact that it has on society. It includes the length of time that the disease has been
            encountered and takes into consideration old and new cases.
            <p></p>
            Incidence, on the other hand, refers to the rate of the manifestation of a certain disease. It is used to measure
            the rate of occurrence of a disease at a given period usually dealing with the number of new cases that are
            diagnosed within a population during a specific period.

          The hazard ratio is a comparison between the probability of events in a treatment group, compared to the probability
            of events in a control group. It’s used to see if patients receiving a treatment progress faster (or slower)
            than those not receiving treatment.

          A Cohort study, used in the medical fields and social sciences, is an observational study used to estimate
            how often disease or life events happen in a certain population. “Life events” might include: incidence rate,
            relative risk or absolute risk.

          In statistics, a confounder (also confounding variable or confounding factor) is a variable that influences
            both the dependent variable and independent variable causing a false association.
            <p></p>
          A confounding variable is an “extra” variable that you didn’t account for. They can ruin an experiment and
            give you useless results. They can suggest there is correlation when in fact there isn’t. They can even introduce
            bias. That’s why it’s important to know what one is, and how to avoid getting them into your experiment in
            the first place.</p>
