The PPI (proton pump inhibitor) drugs really do their job well, reducing stomach acid to virtually nil.

The 5% of our population on PPI drugs are at risk for hip fracture, B12 deficiency, amino acid deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia. One study showed reduced cognition from PPI’s. \n\nGastric acid serves as a defensive barrier to invading bacterial organisms and kills ingested bacteria, before they overwhelm the body’s defenses. With stomach acid turned off by the PPI drug, these bacteria are free to invade. This may explain the increased incidence of infections such as pneumonia, as well as clostridia difficile entero-colitis in patients on PPI’s. Without the acid barrier, small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) may occur.\n\nFor many years there has been concern about the ability of PPI drugs to inhibit the activity of anti-platelet drugs commonly used for patients at risk for heart attack. Could this be the mechanism for increased heart attacks in PPI users? or is there another mechanism?

Here\'s what I woud do.  1 & 2 are to replace the minerals and vitamins that lack of stomach acid has probably caused. 3,4,& 5 are for the bloating and other digestive problems.  6 is to find out the extent of any damage that has been done,  7 is to help get off PPIs. \n1. If you are not already, begin suplementing your diet with calcium citrate, magnesium asparatate, Vitamin D3, and Vitamin K2, as well as an all purpose multi vitamin and mineral.  The Mag, and D3 should be taken with the calcium, as they are necessary to get it absorbed into the bloodstream.  There are several brands of Calcium supplements that contain all three, to make this simpler.  The K2 can be taken at any time.  K2 is to get the calcium out of the bloodstream and to the parts of your body that need it.\n2.  Get a second supplement with just magnesium,  to be taken at a different time of day than the calcium.  The mag you take with calcium gets used up in the absorbption process, so you need more for the bodys other magnesium requirements.  Due to modern agribusiness farming methods, the magnesium level in foods has dropped dramatically over the last 60 years.  All those charts you read that show the typical vitamin and mineral content of individual foods are pretty much uselsss now, as they were created from tests done between 1930 and 1960.  What we eat, where it comes from, and how its grown are all vastly different now, and not for the better.\n3.   Take a probiotic.\n4.   Take digestive enzymes\n \n5.   Reduce carbohydrates in your diet.  The bad backeria in your system love to feed off of and ferment carbs, creating gas.\n 6.  Schedule an appointment with your doctor for tests for osteoporosis.  Also be sure to mention the other issues - stomach irritation, ringing in the ears, bloating, depression/thoughts of siucide.  There could be something else going on.  While I am absolutely in agreement with your opinion that most doctors just repeat what they learned in med school, and do not keep up even with sanctioned medical advances, let alone natural or holistic healing techniques, they can at times be useful.  We just have to remind outselves that they are not Gods.\n7.  If you are down to 10mg/day of omeprazole, and want to continue to work yourself off of it, it should be done gradually.  If there is a 5MG dose available, switch to that.  Or if the 10mg is a pill cut it in half.  If its a capsule, while it can be a bit messy, you can try opening the capsules and taking only half at a time(you can buy empty gel caps).  Other options are taking the 10mg only every other day, or switching to an H2 blocker like Zantac(OTC), starting with the 150mg dose, and gradually reducing to the 75mg, then going every other day, every two days, etc. etc.   If at any time during this process, your heartburn or reflux returns badly, then you know you are going too fast, so back up a step and continue that last step longer.\nGood luck.','20 years on PPIs.

It used to make me feel bloated, acidic and sick.  It got so bad that I stopped eating during the day and just had one meal in the evening as close to bed time as possible.  Then about 10 years ago I went to the doctors and got prescribed Zoton (Lansoprazole), all was good in the world, one 15mg tablet in the morning and I could eat again.\nThis brought the problem of weight gain, I put on about two stones so about 10 years ago I went on a diet.  No alcohol, potatoes and wheat sort of thing.  Whilst I was on the diet I didn’t take the Zoton, it struck me that I didn’t get the bloated acid problem.  When I came off the diet I started eating normally again and the symptoms immediately started again so I tried excluding a few things until I discovered my symptoms only occurred when I ate wheat.\n \nI came off Zoton for about a year and just avoided wheat.  That sounds easy doesn’t it?  It isn’t, it’s in absolutely everything.  I used to think of wheat as being bread and pasta, it’s in Oxo’s chrisps, oven chips, most sauces, beer, sausages, breaded ham, in short most processed food contains it because it’s cheap.  I have to be so careful what I eat and have to check the ingredients on everything.  I find it difficult to eat out and can never eat a sauce or gravy.  It is incredibly sensitive, any wheat at all will set it off.  I once took a bite of a cereal bar without thinking, spat it out without chewing or swallowing any of it and felt sick for two days.\nI moved to France where the culture seems to revolve round the devil grain and being wheat free is a lot harder so I started taking Lansoprazole again (Zoton became hard to get in the UK, here it’s impossible).  I have been taking a generic brand of it for 3 years and have just stopped again to see if it’s causing some side effects.  These effects are so slow coming on I didn’t even think of the Lansoprazole.  I have been suffering terrible insomnia for the last two years and it’s getting worse.  I go to bem drop off quickly then wake again after three hours or so.  I have also been suffering really bad depression, just like a big black cloud coming over me and there is nothing I can do about it.  It’s very early days to say if not taking the meds has made a difference but I am sleeping much better.

Although expensive, she assured me that it was worth it. I saw Dr. Ash for the first time in June 2011. He believes that most of our illnesses are brought on by specific food allergies and processed food that we eat. I went under a ton of tests, found my allergies/intolerances and started changing my diet. I say this with zero exaggeration - changing my diet completely changed my life and made the acid reflux disappear (along with headaches, exhaustion, rashes).

When I started learning about the side effects I decided to quit taking the PPI (omeprazole). I didn’t know about rebound reflux.\n\nI had terrible rebound. It was very painful. But I was determined to stay off PPI. What I decided to do was a food reintroduction similar to the way a baby is weaned from a milk only diet. So I started with very simple foods like bananas and apple juice and gradually worked my way back to a full diet.\n\nFrom my experience I would not recommend going cold turkey off of a PPI, but would do a tapering off as many people posting here have described. I would recommend a simple bland diet while tapering as that was very helpful for me.\n\nAlmost two years ago, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune condition which I believe could very well either be the result of prolonged PPI usage or exacerbated by taking PPIs. A coworker suggested I check into the Paleo Autoimmune Protocol Diet. The diet along with soaking in epsome salt baths helped bring my condition under control. (With assistance of a topical steroid which I have used sparingly and now only for occasional flare ups.)\n\nRecently, beginning last October, so about a year ago I developed a cough which I couldn’t kick. It was different than any cold I have had. My throat and esophagus felt very itchy and my voice was raspy. A couple of months ago it was time for me to have a colonoscopy so I asked my doctor if she would also order an endoscopy so I could find out what was causing my cough.\n\nIt turned out I had very bad esophagitis. My GI doctor prescribed omeprazole 40mg daily and told me I would have to be on it the rest of my life to prevent Barrett’s Oesohpagus and esophageal cancer. I didn’t want to go back on omeprazole but thought I should at least short term.\n\nAfter doing some research online I found two interesting things. There are actually many factors which can cause esophagitis besides acid reflux but doctors almost always attribute it to acid reflux and then prescribe acid-blocking medication. I also found that my autoimmune condition can be present in my esophagus. My condition is Lichen Planus and Esophageal Lichen Planus is related. ELP is considered to be a very rare condition. Lichen Planus is also considered to be rare, however I have found by taking to people on message boards that is is difficult to get a proper diagnosis so many people suffer for years and even decades before getting a correct diagnosis. I suspect that esophageal lichen Planus may also be very under diagnosed and that people are being improperly treated with PPIs which will not help ELP.\n\nSince Corticosteroids were used to treat my skin condition and in the study trial for esophageal lichen Planus the steroid fluticasone was used via an inhaler, I found an over the corner fluticasone and followed the dosage given in the study trial. At my follow up visit from the initial endoscopy, I discussed ELP with my doctor. He had heard of it but was not familiar with it. He had not taken any biopsies of my esophagus during the initial endoscopy because my esophagus was completely inflamed. When I was diagnosed with LP almost two years ago I was also experiencing extreme inflammation so this supports my theory about ELP besides the fact that I fit the patient demographics described in the study.\n\nAfter using fluticasone for thirty days, my cough was gone and the itchy throat irritation had cleared up as well as the general ache I felt in my chest as a result of all the inflammation. Two weeks after the one month of treating, I had the repeat endoscopy. My esophagus was much better. There was still some esophagitis but it was greatly reduced. My doctor took some biopsies this time and I will find out the pathology diagnosis in a couple of weeks.\n\nNow my dilemma is whether I should listen to my doctor and take omeprazole for the rest of my life. I am hoping the pathology results will support my theory that it is ELP and not acid reflux which has caused my esophagitis.\n\nI won’t be taking steroids continually either. I only use them topically when I have a flare up so would do the same or my esophagus. What I have found is that a Paleo diet, exercise, sunshine, and getting enough sleep always helps me. When I get off track from these things is when I have a flare up and also experience weight gain and depression. I now know that weight gain and depressions are symptoms on LP. Also carb-craving happens when your gut flora is out of balance which leads to weight gain and can cause depression too.\n\nAIP Paleo was not easy but over time it has become easier and my food preferences and even my palate has changed.\n\nI believe that taking PPIs led to weight gain, high cholesterol and high blood sugar. First the doctor prescribed PPIs, then came cholesterol reducing medication, and then she wanted to prescribe a blood glucose reducing medication saying it might also help me lose weight. That is when I put the brakes on and decided to get off the pharmaceutical band wagon.\n\nI believe Big Pharma will happily medicate you to death and count their profits all the way to your grave.','I was on a PPI for about 10 years as prescribed by my doctor after experiencing an ulcer.

Yes and No. While it helped provide temporary relief it has also caused me to feel uneasy in more ways than one. I’m not one to be dependent on something for the rest of my life.

The unknowns of how you will react to the process and wondering if I’ll make it worse crossed my mind. Keep in mind everyone is different. What might work for me might not work for you. What you need to do is research and educate yourself on the facts. Figure out a plan and give it a try. I started the process of weaning off in late March. I have been doing 3 week intervals. My first 3 weeks consisted of 30mg for 4 days and on the 5th day 15mg. The next 3 weeks consisted of 30 mg for 3 days and on the 4th day 15mg. Basically, every 3 weeks I’d decrease by 1 day until I got to the point of taking 30mg and 15 mg every other day. I have quit 30mg and the plan is to start the process all over again with the 15mg and a Zantac. I took my first Zantac today and felt pretty good. I’m toying with the idea of just taking Zantac for a few days to see how I do. Hopefully I will feel good enough and I can forget about the 15mg PPI. This could be the turning point for me and I can finally say goodbye to the PPI’s. I will mention taking this approach makes getting off PPI’s easier. That being said you will still have your moments and days with flare up’s. I had my share and still feel it somewhat. I suppose that’s part of it and it will take awhile to bounce back.

I am not a medical professional so I can’t give medical advice but I will try and give you support. You are taking megadoses of the PPI. When you stop or lower the dose too quickly what you are experiencing is ‘acid rebound’. After 10 years on the meds you will have to lower your dose very slowly. If you put into your browser on your computer ‘PPI reducing’ you will come across several support groups with loads of information. One of them is heathboards.com and the other is healingwell.com. My situation was sort of similar to yours. I was on a PPI for 10 years the last one being Nexium 40mgs. In February I started to have issues of not feeling well bloating pain in the stomach, nausea etc. My GP told me to switch to Famotidine. I was so sick trying that, it lasted 3 days and I was back to the GP. He then said try alternating the Nexium every other day to wean myself off it. That didn’t work either. So I was back on the 40mgs nexium with nowhere to go. I then started to do some research and found those 2 groups of people along with this one and I started to learn I could not just stop the ppi. I ended up going to a GI doctor and he told me to alternate the 40mgs nexium for 20mgs of omeprazole and then get onto the 20mgs omeprazole. I did that and suffered through the ‘acid rebound’ which was miserable. From about the 3 1/2 week mark to the 5th week I was feeling terrible. Not every day but on and off mainly bad days. I emerged around week 5 1/2 having more better days than bad. I stayed on that 20mgs for 8weeks then lowered the dose to 15mgs again I had the rebound effect but not quite as badly and it didn’t last quite as long so I knew I could handle it at that point. Again I stayed on 15mgs for around 5 weeks then lowered it to 10mgs which is where I am now. I started in February with this and I am still taking this small dose of PPI. It is a long journey so take heart it can be done. You can help with taking zantac or some famotidine or pepsid. I have found some tea called ‘stomach ease’ in the grocery store and that helped. Also I use a product called ‘acid ease. You can get that from the Vitamin shop or look on line for it. Yes, regular licorice will raise your blood pressure but there is a great product called DGL short for deglycyrhizinated Licorice. They are chewable and I have read of many people finding them helpful, I do. Have you tried aloe vera juice? For me I didn’t find that helpful but some people swear by it. I hope I have been of some help for you. There are many people out there struggling to get off PPI’s that they have been on for a while. Good luck and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.

When I first started reading the disturbing medical literature about nexium [think it was about 2010] I stopped cold turkey. I was no longer a patient of the doctor who prescribed. It had originally been prescribed because on my initial exam with the doctor I had mentioned I had been diagnosed with an ulcer about thirty [30] years ago–it was a one-time occurrence. His response to my information was to send a specimen for a Heliobacter diagnosis [negative] and to put me on nexium. I should have protested but his logic seemed valid–I have been taking NSAIDs for the same 30+ years for osteoarthritis. I have always taken them according to the directions and had/have never had any problems with bleeding. I took nexium daily for about 5 years.\nWithin a few days of stopping I was experiencing what I assume was full blown GERD, pain, heartburn, etc. At the time of the initial reports there was no info on withdrawal from the drug so I just went on through the summer and ultimately saw my primary care doc in the late summer I had lost about 35 pounds [the one good occurrence of the whole fiasco] and was just grazing through the day. I never ate anything close to bed time knowing it would be a long night of acid reflux. My PCD gave me a — guess what — a prescription for zantac and told me how to wean myself off over time. It took me about 6 months to completely back off the drug and for the GERD to only be an occasional annoyance.\nMy gut is changed forever–I have a long list of items I simply cannot eat; I can live without them [spicy foods, very rich foods and most carbonated beverages].\nI guess my response is much more than a reply to adverse effects of nexium, most of all–do not make unilateral decisions on your own without competent medical advice; do not take medications without totally understanding the side effects [although none of the PPI side-effects were known when I began taking it; realize that if you do not have a free-flow dialogue with a physician [even if a board-certified specialist] and you disagree with some of his practices you may need to change doctors.','I have been taking NSAIDs for the same 30+ years for osteoarthritis.

PPI are dangerous and they can wreck your life forever!! 15 years ago there was not much research on the use of PPI so doctors felt it was ok to keep patients on them. But today the consequences of taking them is devastating! Please think hard before using them !!!\n\n','I was on Prevacid for 15 years until I started having 2 to 3 bouts of pneumonia and was on antibiotics on and off several times a year . Three and a half years ago I went to see an herbalist that as my body was breaking down. I\'m very active and sporty and was always strong with lean muscle tone. I could not understand how I was losing muscle tone and feeling very weak, my vision was affected, my stomach was at its worse and my bones ached all over. My herbalist took me off Prevacid overnight. I never looked back. My bouts of pneumonia decreased dramatically. I was diagnosed with Osteopenia last year and I also suffer from neuropathy and my sugar levels were out of whack with borderline diabetes and a weight gain I could not understand. For several years I halted a lot of my activities because I felt so sick all the time and so weak. Needless to say I felt pretty depressed.

I just recently changed Gastroenterologist and was given 4 different type of medications to try for my Ulcers and Gastritis. I have been on Dexilant for 2 years now and was never told that this was not a long term medication. I changed doctors because I still continue to have issues with my stomach. I went to a doctor to begin with because one night I ate a couple baby pickles and shortly afterwards I started experiencing this pain in my sternum that grew to such intensity that I was doubled up on the floor shaking and eventually throwing up. it lasted 3 hours. This happened to me several times and I assumed it was my gallbladder because my sister had the same issues and it was her gallbladder. I lost 20 pounds eating ramen noodle soup because I was scared to eat anything else. I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist and she did every test available. rectal exam showed hidden blood and A Upper GI endoscopy and biopsy showed I had severe gastritis and several ulcers. She told me it was stress related. She put me on 40 mg of Dexilant and have been on it for two years. The pain has not come back but I have frequent nausea especially in the morning along with a Gnawing feeling that only feels better with food. I wake up at night with hiccups, and I have a sore feeling in my sternum from time to time. I am constantly clearing my throat like their is this film on the back of it. The worst of it all is not having any energy. I am not sleepy, just tired. I get mild headaches as well. not sure if it’s related but I have skin issues as well..dry scalp, skin, dry mouth and my face itches sometimes. I also have bruises all over me. This new Doctor I went to see yesterday gave me several prescriptions as well as free samples to try to save me money. He said that some people have to be on medication for life or they choose surgery. It’s finding what medication works best for the person that is the problem. He also mentioned diet and being aware what triggers it and to cut it out of my diet. Tomatoes being one. He is waiting on my records from other Doctor to give me the best advice but last night I took a sample of zegerid he gave me before I went to bed and I know it takes 5 days before medication like this to work but I don’t think it should make you feel worse either. I felt like a ball was wedged in my sternum and I am belching more then usual and my PVC’S are going crazy today and had to take a Atenolol today and have not had to take one in 9 months. I am going to try and change my diet up and look for alternative remedies like baking soda and water to cure this instead of taking medication for life. I usually look to alternative ways to cure but my first Doctor scared me with her talk on my ulcers and how it could eat through my stomach and kill me and also the pain that drove me to seek help was the reason not to question the medication but the lack of energy and nausea is ruling my life and makes me question it all and seek alternative treatment.','I just recently changed Gastroenterologist and was given 4 different type of medications to try for my Ulcers and Gastritis.

I’ve been taking Prilosec for more than 6 years because of Gastric Reflux. Low levels of Vitamin B12 and resulting high levels of homocysteine can cause nerve damage and many reputable studies have linked high homocysteine to higher rates of Alzheimers, cerebrovascular diseases and heart heart attacks. About 3 1/2 years ago I started developing strange sensations in my feet–sort of like the lining of my shoe was wrinkled or my sock wadded up. The problem continued to get more aggrevating and I even saw a neurologist. Tests showed no problem. It began to bother me at night when the sheets touched my toes and felt terrible when I walked on bare floors with no socks. About that time I noticed a new sentence on the information that usually came with my prescription that said to contact your doctor if you notice tingling or numbness of hands or feet. I quickly did research and discovered that reduced acid levels in the stomach could prevent absorption of Vitamin B-12 which in turn can lead to neurological damage due to a increased level of an amino acid in the blood called homocysteine. I did speak to my doctor and he sent me to a neurologist who ran tests and could not find a problem. However, I began taking 250 mcg of B-12 and 400 mcg of folic acid in addition to my multi-vitamin and a cereal with 100% fortification of B vitamins. (Although now retired, I was a Registered Dietitian but worked in business so I had not been involved in therapeutic dietetics in a long time.)\nThe ironic part of the story is that my much younger sister had developed a 4″ long subclavical venous blood clot. After seeing a specialist it was determined through DNA analysis that she had a blood clotting mutation. Since there is a 50/50 chance of a sibling having this mutation, I decided to be tested. I had a high homocysteine level despite my high levels of vitamin supplementation. I not only had that Prothrombin mutation, but another one called C677T MTHFR mutation. It reduces my body’s ability to absorb folic acid—thus increasing my homocysteine level. The hematologist recommended I increase my folic acid to 1000 mcg plus the fortified cereal and multivitamins.\nThe homocysteine did come down from 12.0 to 9.9 within 2 months and was well within normal (7.7) in a year.\nMore importantly, after a great deal of research I have found literally dozens of research papers in highly-regarded scientific and medical journals showing a correlation between high homocysteine and everthing from Alzheimer’s to cerebrovascular disorders to heart diseases. Every one of the studies continues to say more work needs to be done in the area but each one shows the problems are greater when homocysteine is higher. Of course, there is still a question as to whether homocysteine causes these problems or whether it is a side effect of such problems. If you are over 55 or 60 to ask your doctor to run a homocysteine test the next time blood work is done. As we get older, it is more difficult to absorb folic acid and products like Prilosec and Nexium reduce acid levels which reduce absorbtion of B-12. Low levels of each of these vitamins increase your homocysteine level. If your homocysteine level is high it may just be due to insufficient fruits and vegetables in your diet and too much meat or you could have the MTHFR mutation—somewhere between 2-5% of the Caucasian population have it. Fortunately, increased Vitamin B12, folic acid and Vitamin B-6 can help reduce homocysteine and they certainly are inexpensive. But the proper levels should be recommended by a doctor or dietitian based on testing. An imbalance of the three can mask problems like pernicious anemia.\nI should also mention, some doctors are still not familiar with the MTHFR mutation. If your homocysteine level is high and does not respond to multi-vitamins and extra B-vitamins it could be necessary to see a hemotologist to be further tested for the mutation.\nCheck these on the internet:\nGerontology. 2001 Nov-Dec;47(6):324-9.

Over time I began experiencing various deficiencies because the stomach acid suppression resulted in vital nutrients not being absorbed into my body. A Vitamin B12 deficiency set in first, eventually causing me to be lethargic and require more sleep in order to feel rested and have energy to perform essential tasks, such as working 5 days a week. My physician prescribed B12 shots, saying the pill form is not an effective means of supplementation. Duh! Stomach acid suppression began the deficiency in the first place.\nI also experienced low iron levels resulting in “spoon nails” and splitting nails from the outer edge of the nail back toward the cuticle. Doc prescribed an Iron supplement which I continue to take even after 1-1/2 years of being off Aciphex. My nails still haven’t recovered even with iron supplements so a month ago Doc told me to go on a gluten-free diet to improve nutrient absorption in my stomach. I’m not convinced that is the answer.\nI also fear calcium was probably not getting to my bones, and may still not. Regardless of what the Doc says, I’m convinced Aciphex has caused many, many deficiencies in my body, some of which may never be fully corrected. Perhaps my stomach will never function the same as before the Aciphex.\nBefore finally taking myself off Aciphex (PCP Doc recommended I remain on it), I read about several deficiencies in the People’s Pharmacy Q&A column in the newspaper plus other resources. Find a way to get off the acid-suppressing drugs! To transition from Aciphex, I used a natural proprietary blend supplement containing Betaine hydrochloride, one of the acids the stomach naturally produces. The product is Zypan from Standard Process Inc. which I bought at my chiropractor’s office. I took two tablets (700 mg per serving) one hour before each meal, until my stomach naturally began producing the digestive acids again. As recommended along with the supplement, I cut out white potato products when eating beef and pork. For some reason high carb levels cause the meat to digest more slowly thus causing the reflux.\nI no longer use the supplement except when I anticipate a very large meal, e.g., Thanksgiving or Christmas. I occasionally use store-brand Gaviscon or Alka-Seltzer for mild reflux. Interestingly enough, as mentioned by others, most of my reflux today comes after chocolate, carbonated beverages or an extremely large meal. Guess I’ll cut out the HFCS and carbonated beverages and hope for more improvement.','I was on 20 mg Aciphex for 8+ years. Over time I began experiencing various deficiencies.

I do not think those side effects are rare at all with PPI use but rather are common. Esophageal cancer, on the other hand, IS relatively rare, that is, unless you also have Barrett’s, in which case I think the risk is somewhat higher. C. difficile, BTW, is a dysenteric colitis that has become treatment-resistant — which is why it’s now considered superbug — and tends to recur. Depending on the severity of your GERD, I would have a very serious discussion with other GI doctors (as yours seems to have a rigid conception about PPI use) concerning the relative risk of esophageal cancer vs. all of the other serious ills emerging with long-term PPI use.','I was on various PPIs for nearly 20 years due to GERD.

Not smoking, drinking alcohol or caffeine is essential in combination with developing a generally healthier life style.\nIn addition, something I have never heard of before is Centaurium Tincture. You take 15 drops before each meal and it tightens the sphincter at the top of the oesophagus to prevent the reflux. I have been using this for the past 2 days, have not smoked, had alcohol or caffeine but otherwise have had “normal” food (cereal, crumpets, cheese!) and surprisingly, have had reflux!\nI think because I have been on them for so long it’s going to take ages for my body to know what is going on when I suddenly stop so I propose to continue with centaurium to strengthen, ween myself off the drugs, eat copious alkaline forming foods, remain a non smoker and hopefully in 6 months will have just about finished the PPIs!\nGood luck everybody, seriously!

I am 44 years old and I have been on Prilosec for close to 10 years. I recently started drinking lemon and honey in warm water every morning to help lose weight. The only problem was that I was introducing more acid into my system which gave me more heartburn, but knowing that the lemon and honey was natural and the Prilosec wasn’t meant that I had a decision to make. So I chose to get off of the Prilosec, and like many of you I went through a week of hell.\n\nIf you choose to get off of Prilosec PLEASE don’t get discouraged because after your week of hell you will notice things have changed with your body. For instance the first thing I noticed was that it seemed that my stomach went from feeling like a bowling ball to feeling like a soft ball and I lost six pounds within a week. Secondly there were foods that I would eat while on Prilosec such as Italian beef that would give me heartburn anyway, and now I can eat it without any problems. Third when we would go out to eat I would always feel like I was going to throw up, and only eat about half of my food, and just sit there thinking about whether I need to go to the bathroom to throw up or not. This feeling does not allow you to have a pleasurable evening.\n\nI could go on all day about how good I feel since giving up Prilosec, but I’m sure it is different for everyone. This is my advice on how to succeed in getting off of Prilosec. Start with a half of a fresh squeezed lemon in a warm glass of water with 2 or 3 tbsp. of honey every morning. Just a reminder you will feel a little burn after you drink it but it will go away shortly. Stay away from soda, candy, and processed foods, as they seem to cause heartburn. Secondly a healthy diet is important, for example when eating at home only cook with the leanest beef that you can buy, and include fruit and vegetables. Why you ask? Think about grandma and grandpa, did they have heartburn? no, Why? because they didn’t have processed foods back then. It was meat, potatoes, vegetables, and fruit which all contain nutrients to stabilize your body’s ph level. The human body can only use the nutrients that you put in it, most if the nutrients have been cooked or boiled out of processed foods, therefore try to use as much fresh fruits, vegetables, and meat as you can.\n\nYou might not totally get rid of heartburn or acid reflux this way so I have one more suggestion. Do you remember the old saying “an apple a day will keep the doctor away” ? Well in the afternoon or evening or after a meal if you start to feel like you are getting heartburn try eating an apple. Doing this somehow stabilizes the acid in your stomach and the burn will go away.\nThanks','I\'m 44 years old and I\'ve been on Prilosec for close to 10 years.

I wanted to post my success story here. Especially after reading so many of these other posts and getting every little bit of info I could from them. Yes I had success, yes it took 8 weeks, yes it required multiple supplements, and yes there were some bad, nauseous moments.\n\nIn a nutshell, here’s my history. For many years I had GERD or acid reflux. Took Prilosec daily for over two years but still had reflux and grit. Also took Tums as need, slept on my left side, had a wedge to elevate my head. I also became very constipated at times. It seemed like stomach motility had stopped, and food would just sit in my belly for hours. This makes sense since stopping stomach acid production would stop digestion.\n\nI had once, in the past, stopped Prilosec cold-turkey, and on the second day had the most unbelievable acid attack in the middle of the night. With acid welling into my mouth, through my nostrils. Uncontrollable coughing up lots of phlegm and acid into the toilet while sobbing and choking. Went on for over an hour until I scarfed down massive numbers of Tums and took the Prilosec. I think you have to experience this to know what I’m talking about.\n\nThis happens because the acid producing cells in the stomach keep multiplying in response to Prilosec stopping acid production. So you end up with massive numbers of suppressed acid producing cells. When you finally stop Prilosec (or other acid reducing medication) ALL the cells start producing more acid than could ever be naturally produced.\n\nHere’s the quick version of what I did. Believe me, I followed other people’s advice on this, am grateful to them, and now want to help others with my experience.\n\n1) I bought chewable DGL supplements, papaya enzyme tablets, and Tums antacid. Plus a week long, daily pill dispenser container to keep me on track with the varying doses of Prilosec. 2 smaller pill containers to carry the DGL and enzymes in my purse while eating out. A pill splitter is also helpful.\n\nThe DGL, Papaya and Tums “arsenal” was someone else’s idea. Thanks so much. Have this READY before starting as you will need it.\n\n2) I split the Prilosec tablets in half. I took the 1/2 pill every morning, first thing, for 2 weeks.\n\n3) I then filled my pill dispenser for every other day. I took the 1/2 dose every other day.\n\n4) I then split the Prilosec into 1/4 dose. This was trickier, but I used the pill splitter first, then a paring knife. I took the 1/4 dose for 4 weeks.\n\nNOTE: After 2 weeks, I had tried to go to every other day with the 1/4 pill, but I couldn’t do it. Too much acid and nausea. Also had another health issue during this period (Lyme diagnosis and antibiotics) so just went easy on myself.\n\n5) After 4 weeks at 1/4 dose, stopped taking all Prilosec.\n\n6) Off Prilosec and continuing with the DGL and Papaya, and regime of eating smaller and less protein-based meals.\n\nFor every meal I took the chewable DGL before eating and Papaya Enzymes after eating. I did not skip meals or snacks – thanks to someone else’s advice. If you get overly hungry the acid starts filling and you get nauseous. I ate small meals, high in veggies, fruits and carbs. Do not overeat protein and fatty fried foods. Do not stuff yourself. Absolutely, do not eat before going to bed or late in the evening. Avoid red meat and eat small amounts of poultry and fish instead. Heavy protein requires acid to digest, and at this point your digestion and acid production are very messed up.\n\nDrink plenty of water and other liquids like tea or soup – but not so much as to overfill your belly. Whenever acid or grit starts welling up, sip some water. Carry a water bottle with you, and drink as needed.\n\nTake Tums as needed whenever too much acid is being produced.\n\nI had tried taking ACV (apple cider vinegar) remedy during this time, and realized this didn’t make sense. Just get off the Prilosec, not complicate this process. Pamper yourself, let this one goal be the main focus, and not muddy the waters with other cures.\n\nThere was nausea at many points of this cure. Every time I reduced a dose, there would be a few episodes of nausea and dizziness. Usually around and 2nd and 3rd day. Just take more DGL and papaya, plus Tums. Slow down. Some of the dizziness happened after trimming hedges or scrubbing the tub or other housework. All the vigorous arm movements and stretching my arms seemed to get my belly jumbled up. Then I would get quite dizzy and nauseous. This also happened when I tried to reduce the 1/4 dose to every other day (see NOTE under #4.)\n\nThere were a few times I simply had to use a Fleet suppository for constipation. With all the small meals, dietary changes, nausea, digestion not working – I needed relief. Again, be forgiving of yourself, and make getting off Prilosec your main focus. Do what you have to do to stick with the plan of reducing, then stopping Prilosec.\n\nIf it gets really bad, on that day, just take another Prilosec DOSE. So another 1/2 pill or 1/4 pill. And forgive yourself, and stick to plan the next day. For me, there was a lot of shuffling of split pills in my week long container. Do what you have to do, and don’t let one day’s backsliding get you off track.\n\nI stayed on the 1/4 dose for 2 extra weeks because I needed to slow down at that point. Do what you need to do to ultimately get off. If that means extending a reduction period – do what works for you. I had planned for 6 weeks, it took 8. That’s not failure.\n\n(BTW – I had also started taking a high-quality vitamin B and high-quality magnesium supplement during the 2nd month. Look up what high-quality B is and high-quality usable magnesium is. Not cheap, but I felt some of my other issues could benefit from these. Not sure if this helped or hindered the Prilosec withdrawal. But one of the side effects of long term Prilosec dependency is B and magnesium deficiencies. ?.)\n\nGood luck everyone.','For many years I had GERD.

It was 2 years ago!) The procedure I referred to is called TIF; it goes through the mouth, I believe; therefore, no incisions. However, because of its nature, it’s not as “tight” a wrap as the Nissen (I will comment on that later.) Unfortunately, the TIF *still* isn’t approved by my insurance company, and apparently others. There is a study being done, to try to make it more apparent that it’s a better alternative (in the eyes of insurance cos. at least) to the Nissen. The study is a terrific deal, if you qualify – the procedure and the required pre-tests are completely paid for by the study.\nYou can look into it at: http://acidrefluxstudy.com/ If that didn’t print, it’s acid reflux study dot com\nI was on Protonix for at least 10 yrs. It worked fantastically, and I was very pleased with the results. But I eventually learned that one should only be on it temporarily. It reduces the acid in the stomach, which among other things, prevents the absorption of calcium. I am now a menopausal-age woman, and not absorbing any calcium for 10 yrs. is a very bad thing! Also, the acid in the stomach keeps polyps from forming. Without the acid, I was developing polyps; those were benign, but how long would that last? In addition, the acid I still had in my stomach could get in my esophagus, and was causing lesions. Those themselves can become cancer.\nAlthough I didn’t qualify for the TIF study, I was so ready to be done with the whole mess, that I went ahead and had the Nissen done, rather than wait for the TIF to be approved. I prefer the light anesthesia that was used for the colonoscopy and upper GIs I’ve had. This was done with general anesthesia, but I didn’t have any problems. Any surgery is a risk, but I didn’t like the risk I was taking *not* having the hiatal hernia taken care of. I am thrilled that I had it done. I have 5 small scars on my stomach, which will go away eventually. And at my age, not many people get the “privilege” :-) of seeing my stomach anyway. I’m off the meds, can eat anything, and have had no heartburn since.\nI admit that most of the tests I had to go through, to see if I qualified for the TIF, were quite unpleasant. And I don’t know that I wouldn’t have had to have some of them for the Nissen anyway. But I seriously doubt there will be any occasion where I will ever have to have them again and for that, I am *extremely* grateful! As I mentioned earlier about the TIF being not as “tight” as the Nissen, if you are familiar with how fundoplication is done, a ‘chunk’ of the stomach is wrapped around the lower end of the esophagus in order to close up the extraneous opening. Because the TIF goes through the esophagus (as opposed to going through the stomach), it’s not possible to get such a snug fit. But that might be a good thing.\nOne big complaint I have after having the surgery, is that I am unable to burp! I can do little burps, that come from my esophagus, above the valve to the stomach. But sometimes, I really want/need a rip-roaring one that comes all the way from my toes! The doctor said that I may be able to burp in the future, but so far, no go; it’s been 4 mos. since my surgery. I suppose if, in years ahead, I’m finally able to do it, I can make an exciting announcement here! ;-)\nBy the way, all the stuff that was done for this procedure, none of it hurt, so don’t be put off by that. I have a tiny bit of weird sensation from one of the incisions, when fabric rubs across it some particular way, but I know that that will go away eventually. Whatever was done inside, well, there are no pain nerves in there, I suppose. The recovery period is kinda difficult, though. I was severely restricted in what I could eat, for about 6 wks. But this is so that the swelling at the esophagus/stomach juncture (which doesn’t hurt or show) can heal, and that the tissues can bind together. It’s mainly a method of building up your ability to eat more “durable” food, much like you would introduce new foods to a baby. The first 2 wks. are liquids only, and I discovered that almost all liquids are sweet. You’d be surprised how thrilled you’ll be to eat a vegetable!\nI believe I’ve gone on long enough here.

I\'ve had severe acid reflux and other problems for most of my life (since junior high school, which was about 900 years ago), and when I was finally prescribed pantoprazole a couple of months ago it changed my quality of life significantly. I used to walk around in fairly constant discomfort, eating was always painful and caused heartburn, acid reflux, etc, and it was very hard to sleep at night. But suddenly, all of that went away and I can\'t believe it took this long for a doctor to prescribe this for me.\n\nI said all of that to make the point that I understand the situation and am in the same boat. So I was glad to see this question, and it helped me get better informed through the different answers provided here.\n\nSo I wanted to add some additional information that I came across about this issue. Besides the B12 issues raised in other answers, one area of potential concern with prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors is the possible association with development of fundic gland polyps (abnormal growths of the mucus membrane in the upper part of the stomach above where the esophagus enters the stomach). This association is still being debated, however, and even if true the risk of cancer is going to depend on the cause of the polyps, and there\'s so far no indication that polyps possibly arising from proton pump inhibitor use would be linked to increased risk of cancer.\n\nThere is also a possible association between proton pump inhibitors and atrophic gastritis, which can lead to anemia, B12 deficiency, and other potential problems. As with the polyps, there is apparently some debate about the role played by proton pump inhibitors with regard to atrophic gastritis.\n\nIt sounds like the key is how long a patient uses the inhibitors, and perhaps just as importantly how long the inhibitors are used uninterrupted. My own doctor wants me to cease taking them after the end of January, and try to see how I do without the medication. But he is not confident that I will be able to go for a prolonged period without it, and so the cessation will mainly be a break in usage of the medication.\n\nI\'ve found that it\'s very easy to help maximize the results from the medication as well.  For example, try switching to lactose-free milk and a butter substitute (I love butter and don\'t like replacements much, but Earth Balance makes a \"buttery spread\" that\'s pretty excellent), and some of the side-effects of proton pump inhibitors can be reduced or even eliminated (especially gas, nausea, and bowl irregularities). I am -- or rather, was -- a major coffee drinker (I am not exaggerating when I say I consumed about two pots of coffee per day by myself, I really did drink it all day long), but had to cut down dramatically due to my heart situation, and it ended up also helping reduce some of the associated gastrointestinal side-effects of the medication as well.','I suffer from a hiatal hernia that causes my heart to misfire at times, so I take pantoprazole.

Following an endoscopy in 2000 I was given 15 mg which was increased to 30 mg. Over the years the strength of this medication has been between 15 and 30. I have taken it as prescribed every day. Both my father and brother died from cancer of the esophagus. I recently had a further endoscopy which revealed my hernia was slightly bigger and I had stage 3 ulcers on my esophagus (I believe it goes from stage 1 to 4). The hospital consultant increased the Lansoprozole to 30 twice daily with a further endoscopy in 8 weeks time. I\'m hoping the ulcers will have healed by then and left nothing sinister. I know how important it is for me to take these tablets as they could be saving my life, especially at the moment. Although other health problems have come on whilst taking this medication I never made any connection. I\'ve been told my muscles in my lower back, right side have dropped 3 inches and the muscles in my right leg \'have died\' also the tendon in my right leg has \'died\', together with painful nerves on my right side. I have no strength in my muscles and accepted this as just another condition I suffered from which is very painful and debilitating. I have had two broken feet from two falls over the last 15 years and told I have osteoporosis. I have also been diagnosed with chronic fatigue. In short I\'ve got the worst health problems in my family and extended family, although I have a healthy lifestyle. I just acceped that I didn\'t hsve good health. I think the muscle weakness is the worst of my problems as this is always limiting and debilitating at times. Since my Lansoprozole was increased a month ago my muscle problems and bones have been worse (if that\'s possible) and this made me look on the internet to see if anyone else had the same or similar problem/s and I found this really good forum. My biggest problem is muscle weakness and I wonder if anyone else has the same muscle problems as me which also started after taking ppi\'s. Also problems with bones and/or fatigue once again from commencement of meds. My muscle weakness commenced after 2000 without me making any connection to my meds until it got worse with the increased doze of Lansoprozole. I\'m thinking this is a light bulb moment for me as the further weakness coincided with the increased dose. Please let me know if any of you also have muscle weakness and how long you have been on the meds. I know I need to be on these tablets but am thinking although its never been suggested a hernia op might help me. So also let me know if you have had one and if it helps. It would seem a lot of people wish to reduce or stop medication completrly. Please consult your doctor before doing eitherof these things. Hope someone out there can help me because if this is a common symptom I\'m going to have to see if an op is the way forward and try and get my life back.\n\nSo grateful for your advice on pantoprazole. I\'m going to ask to try this. I think I need to stick to Lansoprozole until the endoscopy, but will ask to change, I\'m also going to ask for blood tests and B12.

Many people who have delayed gastric emptying experience extreme GERD/LPR, bloating, excessive burping, malabsoprtion of nutrients. Some people even feel nauseated or have stomach pains. In worse cases you can experience vomiting. \n\nMost gastroenterolgist do not believe we need acid to digest our food. So they will never test you for Low stomach acid. Also, many GI doctors do not realize you can have delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis) with NO vomiting so they will usually not test you for delayed gastric empyting either. \n\nThere is a test called the gastric emptying test which can measure how fast your food is moving out of the stomach. This test is used to diagnose delayed gastric emptying but it does not measure if your stomach is producing the correct amount of acid. \n\nI should warn you there is a withdrawal symptom from stopping a PPI after being on this medication two to three weeks or longer.

Because of this I decided to stop taking them since I was never actually diagnosed with GERD when I was put on them. When doing research I found out about the rebound and what causes it.\n\nA little bit about what I have found is that the body produces Gastrin which signals the cells in the stomach to produce acid. From some of the documentation I have read about PPI\'s and H2 blockers, is they block the signals being sent which can make your stomach produce little to no acid. After being on PPI\'s or H2 blockers for any amount of time, the Gastrin levels in your body goes up because your body notices that your stomach does not contain enough acid to digest the food properly. One thing I\'m not sure on as I have not found any evidence, is if the longer you are on medication, the more your Gastrin levels go up, so the longer rebound lasts. After reading about different studies, multiple experiences from different people, and blogs from people experiencing rebound, I have a theory that as long as a person is taking any sort of medication to block the signals to produce acid in the stomach, Gastrin levels may stay high, making it difficult to stop taking the medication.\n\nI am sort of testing this theory out, although I know it would be different from person to person depending on the underlying causes of the acid reflux, by not taking my medication and waiting to see if the symptoms go down at all. So far I am on week 3 and have noticed a huge difference on the rebound as my body slowly returns the Gastrin levels back to normal. The first week was horable, non-stop heartburn 24/7 with the first 2 days feeling like a living hell. So far with a diet of white meats, fruits, and vegetables, I have managed to have more good days than bad as long as I eat smaller meals multiple times a day. I usually eat 5 times a day, although for some this may be difficult. I have noticed that seasonings on my food have not changed the amount of reflux have experienced.\n\nI have also done research into different types of food that triggers reflux more than others and why. What I have found is that some foods will trigger the body to produce more acid for digestion while others trigger the body for not so much. It seems as though that processed foods as well as complex carbs tend to create more acid, which triggers more intense reflex. Foods that are more natural seem to not trigger as much acid and cause little to no reflux such as fruits and vegetables. There are some fruits that seem to do more help because they are a little acidic and do not need as much acid production. I have also been chewing my food more finely to lower the amount of time it needs to sit in the stomach which has been helping.\n\nBased on what other\'s have been through, I think my experience has not been as bad, but it has been worse than other\'s as well. I still have some bad days but overall, I think things are getting better slowly. I will say that I do miss a lot of the processed foods I used to eat more, oreos and doughnuts, but because of the extra energy I have now and knowing that it is better for me overall, I tend to not put myself in a situation where I am hungry and those items are sitting around. It also helps that we don\'t have any junk food in the house and when we shop for groceries, we tend to stay away from those isles.\n\nNot sure if it will help but I have also started taking Prebiotics, Probiotics, Mastic Gum, and DGL for my problems. I can\'t say if any of these have helped or not but figured it couldn\'t hurt since they are all natural.\n\nI wish you the best and hope that you find something that works.','I was on PPI\'s for almost 8 years and learned about how they lower stomach acid so your food doesn\'t digest properly and can cause your body to not get all of the nutrients from the foods you eat that you need.

Apologies in advance for the long post, but I feel it\'s important to give the full history.\n\nTo give you some background, I\'m 44 now and have been on PPI\'s (Omeprazole or Lanzoprazole) since I was 18. so that\'s 26 pears in total. Over the last 7 or 8 years I\'ve had a number of weird problems, none of which I\'d connected to PPI\'s, stupidly perhaps, I\'d just never really thought of it, or perhaps expected medical professionals to point these things out. For instance things started, roughly 8 years ago, with high levels of anxiety, for no apparent reason. I\'d wake in the mornings with these huge feelings of anxiety, and had no idea why. This got worse and worse over the course of a couple of years, until I then started getting chest pains. Obviously at that point I did start to get genuinely worried and went to my GP for help. I was then sent for an ECG and a treadmill test, both of which showed up as normal, other than a slightly higher resting heart rate than normal. I was then effectively dismissed, however the problem was getting worse. I was subsequently referred to a cardiologist, who did further ECG tests, another treadmill test, and even an echocardiogram and a 24 hour ECG. Again, all of which came out as normal, other than the higher than average resting heart rate.\n\nAnyway, about 3 years ago I starting getting palpitations as well, which on top of the chest pain is obviously quite scary. This time, as I\'d been down the heart route a number of times, I was referred to an endocrinologist. I therefore had multiple blood and urine tests, which ended up showing increased adrenaline levels and a slightly raised white blood cell count, which apparently can mean you\'re carrying an infection of some kind. I was then sent back for the same tests to double check, however this time the adrenaline tests came back as normal, so again I was dismissed. \n\n2 years ago I relocated from London to the north of England, which obviously meant a change of GP etc. This GP decided he\'d refer me to an Endocrinologist again, as he thought it was odd that the 2 tests I\'d had done were different. Anyway, I had further blood and urine tests done, and even an MRI, as they were looking for a suspected adrenaline producing tumor. Again, everything came back as normal, apart from the slightly high white blood cell count.\n\nThe GP then referred me back to a cardiologist, which was a few months ago now. The cardiologist decided this time to do, the usual blood tests, a stress and rest Myoview scan, which is where they track the movement of blood around your heart under stressed and rested conditions. He also had me do a 7 day ECG. \n\nThis brings me up to date, where this week I went to see the cardiologist for the results. Basically, he explained to me that the Myoview scan all showed up as completely normal, and the blood tests again were normal, apart from a slightly increased white blood cell count. However, the 7 day ECG showed that my heart was frequently speeding up and occasionally slowing down, to the point of sometimes stopping for as much as 3 seconds. His response to this was that I needed drugs to slow the heart rate, but also a pace maker to stop the heart from slowing down completely. Needless to say I was a little freaked out, and said I needed time to think, despite the cardiologist strongly recommending I need the pace maker fitting. I was obviously VERY worried about the prospect of having a pace maker fitted at age 44, and needed to gather my thoughts before moving forward.\n\nSo that\'s where I am, and as a result, and from a little pushing from my mother who\'d read various things, I decided to look into the long term effects of PPI use, which is where I suddenly discovered mention of side effects such as anxiety, chest pains and irregular heart rate. So I\'m now in a position where I have a cardiologist who is strongly recommending I get a pace maker fittied but I\'m now beginning to strongly believe my problem is actually related to decades of taking PPI medication.\n\nSo I\'d love to hear people\'s thoughts as to whether I\'m right in believing PPI\'s may be my real problem. And if so, after 26 years how do I come off of them?\n\nThanks to anybody that\'s gotten this far through my first post, and I\'d REALLY appreciate it if anybody gives some feedback.','To give you some background, I am a male, age 44 now and have been on PPI\'s (Omeprazole or Lanzoprazole) since I was 18. so that\'s 26 years in total.

The problem got so bad I was sleeping only about 3 hours a night and was becoming suicidal. I wound up taking a 4 month medical leave of absence from work. Meanwhile the doctors told me that it was very important to keep taking the PPI’s and my other drugs as they didn’t believe they had anything to do with the anxiety. The only thing that counteracted my anxiety symptoms was powerful and highly addictive benzodiazepine drugs. I had all kinds of medical tests and the doctors could find nothing. The doctors all told me my medications had nothing to do with anxiety. Finally a few months later a friend told me to stop taking all the prescriptions I was taking at the time. …All off them, all at once! Within a day or 2 the anxiety stopped. By process of elimination, I figured out that the offending drug was Aciphex. A repeat exposure confirmed it. Any attempts at taking other PPI’s produced similar problems. It subsequently took a couple of months to get off the addictive benzodiazepine. Fortunately I can still take H2 blockers.\n\nI now feel a moral responsibility to tell others about my horrible experience. When I first had the anxiety reaction to PPI’s, there was nothing on the internet to help me figure out what was going on. The experience cost me dearly in other ways too extensive to go on about here. It was quite simply the worst experience of my life. I was in living hell. It took me several months to recover from the situation.\n\nFortunately for me, with H2 blockers and dietary changes, my GERD symptoms are not as bad as they once were and are pretty much under control. However, in the meantime, I have discovered I have the same severe anxiety reaction from other drugs including gabapentin, azithromycin, and diet drugs containing amphetamines. I absolutely have no idea what these drugs have in common, but I have learned to immediately trust my recognition of an anxiety reaction when it occurs from taking a prescription. Otherwise I am anxiety free and pretty much a happy person who enjoys life. I take no anti-depressants or anything like that and I feel blessed that my experience with PPI’s is now a distant memory.','I have GERD and I had a tragic experience with PPI drugs. about 13 years ago I started taking Aciphex. about 3 months after I started taking it, I started experiencing horribly debilitating anxiety and chronic panic attacks.

This is the thing, though. Ideally you\'d be seen by a GI doctor, but at this point you don\'t have insurance, so you can\'t. The PPI helps you. If you can afford to continue taking it, I would suggest you do that until you have an opportunity to see a GI doc.\n\nOf course, you can take it for the two weeks recommended and see if things get back to normal for you, but if you truly have GERD, chances are you will need to continue. If you can go off and on, you could avoid the rebound issue (when you take it nonstop for quite a while, when you go off you get more acid.), but if you can\'t, you can\'t. \n\nUntil you get under the care of a GI doc, you\'ll have to do what works, and if it makes you feel better, then it\'s protecting your esophagus, which is important.\n\nGoogle \"GERD triggers\", and stay away from foods that cause you reflux. Elevate the head of your bed by putting blocks or books under the legs. This will help keep acid in your stomach at night (using gravity), when it\'s likely to travel up your esophagus.\n\nRead this document that provides information about the best way to take PPIs and get the most out of them:\nwww.practicalgastro.com/pdf/January07/Jan07FrankArticle.pdf\n\nIf you need to take PPIs to protect your esophagus and feel comfortable, in my opinion, that\'s what you should do. I started taking them probably 17 years ago, am 60, and my bones have hung in there just fine. And I have double whammy...I have to take steroids for asthma.\n\nIncrease your calcium and vitamin D intake...eat foods high in calcium. Generally eat a healthy diet. You could also take a general vitamin supplement...it couldn\'t hurt, as long as it doesn\'t bother your stomach.\n\nIt\'s important that you find a way to heal your esophagus and stomach, so you can get comfortable.

Some sites suggest to decrease dosage to one pill a day to one pill every other day and so on...and after that, see how it goes.

Notice there are now vitamins being marketed that are geared towards people taking PPI\'s. \n*The Protonix manufacturer states on the website that they do not have clinical tests for long term use. It was only intended for short term use.\n*PPI\'s prevent acid in your stomach - this acid has a purpose, one of which is to kill certain bacteria before it gets to your intestine - if the bacteria gets into your intestines, you can develop an overgrowth of bad bacteria which can cause symptoms of lactose intollerance. I personally had this experience. The GI was able to diagnose this overgrowth, provide an antibiotic, and currently I can drink a glass of milk with no ill effects.\n*Add up how much you spend on prescription copays for Protonix.\n\nAsk the GI about repair of the hernia. Why just keep treating the symptom by ingesting drugs forever if you can resolve the root of the problem by surgery? Of course, surgery is not an option in all cases and I realize that; but if it is an option for you then you may want to pursue it. \n\nIf you do have surgery, then take the monthly Protonix copay and put it away each month - eventually you\'ll have enough $$ saved up to treat yourself to something wonderful and you won\'t have had to alter your regular budget.','I was on Protonix for 10 years and then came the time it stopped working and I had to go stronger.

In fact, my ENT was the one who originally recommend PPIs because my throat was so red. This was after Sinus surgery. With more LPR symptoms over the past 2 years, my sinuses have also gotten worse.\n\nA year ago, my GI Doc suggested looking into surgery. So, I had another EDG and scheduled PH and Manometry Tests. My EGD was negative for Barretts but showed some inflammation at the LES Junction. I researched the Nissen and was sort of scared of having a major surgery being so young so I decided to not have the PH and Motility Test. I also have a 4 year old and 2 year old so the thought of having a surgery with tough recovery and 2 kids also turned me off.\n\nBut a year later with symptoms slowly getting worse, I am considering surgery. I am scheduled to have a PH Test and Manometry test next week and then see if it\'s a viable option.\n\nFWIW, I\'ve tried a variety of diets without much luck (gluten free, dairy free, does seem to help a bit). I stopped drinking coffee (decaf and caff) but still drink alcohol a couple times a week. The coffee actually makes my LPR/GERD way worse that alcohol.\n\nI\'ve read many clinical studies and it looks like the Nissen has a high success rate not only for GERD/LPR but also shows some improvement in extraesophogeal symptoms, like sinus.\n\nMy sinus symptoms are swelling only, non-allerginic rhinitis. I\'ve had allergy tests and food tests and nothing shows up (except Coffee). I\'m convinced that the majority of my sinus issues are GERD/LPR related. \n\nLast detail, 2 years ago I had a bone scan and it showed minor osteopenia in my back. So I would love to get off PPIs for that reason, among others.\n\nSo I guess this leads me to a few questions.\n\n- Assuming my PH Tests and Manometry show I\'m a good candidate, am I crazy to have a NF so young? I would absolutely love to not have to take such a powerful and expensive medication and better my quality of life.\n\n- It seems like after 10 years the wraps start to loosen and symptoms show up again. Is the process to to just have another surgery? That would be a lot of surgeries for me if so.\n\n- And anyone out there who has had Sinus/breathing symptoms improve after having the Nissen? I\'ve seen this happen in some studies and wondering about real world experiences. \n\nMany thanks in advance!\nPost Edited (PaleoPop) : 12/30/2013 10:12:58 AM (GMT-7)','I\'m 32 years old and been on PPIs for over 12 years.

The premise is that many people with GERD actually do not have enough acid, the food sits in the stomach and “stews” causing higher pressure in the stomach which in turn, causes acid to go back up the esophagus.\n\nJust doing these two things has made a world of difference and both are very inexpensive ways as a possible alternative. Google the use of the HCI to understand how much to use however. They generally have you start out with up to 3 pills with each meal until you feel a slight burning.

Coincidentally, I was also diagnosed, or most likely misdiagnosed, with RA at this time and was started on two other medications, Methotrexate and Meloxicam that are known to compromise bone health.  Meanwhile, my DEXA scores continued to decline, yet none of my doctors ever suggested there could be a correlation between the meds I was taking and bone loss.  Actually, quite the opposite.  Their recommendation was that I take additional drugs, specifically those designed to \"build bone,\" (albeit not healthy bone), which carry their own worrisome side effects.  While I understand that bone fracture is a real risk, my concerns regarding these drugs outweigh their potential benefits.\n\nAside from being worried and frustrated, it wasn\'t until my sister, who was in treatment for metastatic breast cancer, began to question the relationship between Omeperazole, Methotrexate and Meloxicam and bone loss.  To make a very long, multi-year learning process short, I\'ve been able to discontinue the use of Meloxicam and reduce my Methotrexate dosage.  Unfortunately it\'s too late to rebuild the bone I\'ve lost and my greatest challenge still lies with Omeperazole.  I\'m convinced that use of this drug for three decades this is the root cause of my Osteoporosis and while I\'m again currently trying to wean myself from this drug, I only get so far without becoming too uncomfortable to continue.  Finding this forum today has been a gift and I\'m going to begin anew to become Omeperazole free.\n\nUnfortunately, yes.  In one form or another.   As I remember, when I began having acid reflux symptoms my PCP prescribed either Prevacid or Prilosec.  He never suggested I discontinue the medication as long as it provided relief.  When these meds became available over the counter, insurance no longer paid for them and I switched to the comparable OTC dose instead.  Throughout these years, every doctor I\'ve ever seen has been made aware that I take omeperazole and none of them have discussed the concerns of long term use or suggested that taking it compromises bone health, including two Rheumatologists who should know it\'s effects!  I do remember that at one point, many years ago I was told I have a hiatal hernia, but it was never confirmed with an endoscopy or by other diagnostic tests.  The only saving grace to this story is that my history of acid reflux prevents me from taking Fosamax,  Prolia, etc for Osteoporosis.  \n\nReading my own words makes me feel incredibly stupid but like so many drugs, the effects associated with  using them are unfortunately not known for many years.   \n\nI\'ve never been able to take a break from Omeperazole because after two days of not taking it I\'m too miserable to continue.  This year, in late August, I tried again to wean off this drug by cutting 1/4 from the end of the 20mg tablet.  That went well for two weeks.  This past Monday I then took only 1/2 of the tablet.  Within 48 hours I had a sore throat, persistent cough and scratchiness deep in my throat (esophagus)?  After reading these are all side effects of discontinuing Omeperazole, I gave up and took a full tablet yesterday and again this morning.   Fortunately my sore throat and coughing is much improved and the scratchiness is all but gone.  It\'s hard for me to isolate any other side effects of Omeperazole but when I started back on the full tablet yesterday I had some dizziness and I think it does increase urination.  \n\nSadly,  after reading posts on other websites from people who have attempted to discontinue Omeperazole after long term use, even with alternative medications and dietary changes, the success rate and comfort level seems very low.  This is probably a \"forever\" drug.

I have been on this drug for 30 years, daily, the dosage is 20mg, prilosec-omeprazole. My first bone density (DEXA) scan in 2008 at the age of 65 showed a -2.8 reading in my spine. I\'ve never been able to take a break from Omeprazole because after two days of not taking it I\'m too miserable to continue.  This year, in late August, I tried again to wean off this drug by cutting 1/4 from the end of the 20mg tablet.  That went well for two weeks.  This past Monday I then took only 1/2 of the tablet.  Within 48 hours I had a sore throat, persistent cough and scratchiness deep in my throat (esophagus)?  After reading these are all side effects of discontinuing Omeprazole, I gave up and took a full tablet yesterday and again this morning. Fortunately my sore throat and coughing is much improved and the scratchiness is all but gone.  It\'s hard for me to isolate any other side effects of Omeprazole but when I started back on the full tablet yesterday I had some dizziness and I think it does increase urination.  I\'ll be on this drug forever it seems.',' MaliaOnMaui','24.09.2017.','https://patient.info/forums/discuss/i-ve-been-on-omeperazole-for-so-many-years-i-don-t-know-how-it-all-started--612841',0),(1170,'I have been taking Prilosec for over 20 years.

And apologies for accidentally also posting in the Reflux Esophagitis area. \n\nHistory: \n\nI\'ve been dealing with GERD for almost 20 years. I am 38 now. For 10 of those years, I\'ve been on PPI\'s, mostly Esomeprazole (Nexium). In that time I\'ve had 4 endoscopies:\n\n- My first endoscopy, 10 years ago, revealed mild esophageal inflammation. I also had gallbladder dyskinesia. My gallbladder was subsequently removed. After removal, I was off PPI for about a year because no symptoms. GERD symptoms came back. \n\n- My second revealed mild eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), with an hpf of 18. I was started on budesonide and kept on Nexium. \n\n- My third revealed the EoE was well controlled, but now I had an \"Irregular Z-line.\" This was not biopsied, as in the US, standard procedure is to not biopsy the irregular z-line. \n\n- My fourth -- which I pursued as a consequence of getting a workup for fundoplication -- showed the irregular z-line again. This was biopsied and showed goblet cells. I\'m now scheduled for a scope in a year, and scopes every 3 years thereafter. \n\nThe z-line\'s tongues, it seems, extends only to about .5cm in my case. \n\nAs part of the surgical workup, I also had an esophageal manometry test done, and a 24hr pH impedance.\n\n- The esophageal manometry revealed that my esophagus was failing 60% of the time. \n\n- The 24hr pH impedance test revealed that I had the normal number of reflux events and esophageal acid exposure. My DeMeester score was around 4. However, my bolus clearance time was a little slow. \n\nThe suspicion is that my Barrett\'s was caused by my esophagus\'s inability to clear acid during regurgitation. Indeed, I can feel stuff \"sticking\" there after meals. Warm water tends to help this some. \n\nIt should also be noted that within the past 10 years, I\'ve lost almost 120lbs (52.43kg). I was quite corpulent in my youth. I am 6\'0\" tall (183cm) and currently weigh 210lbs (95.25kg). I still have some to lose, particularly in the gut, but that\'s moving along -- mostly because I\'m afraid of eating: every meal brings reflux. Every meal, in my mind, brings me one step closer to cancer. And it\'s all I can think about now. \n\nQuestion: \n\nIs there ANY way to improve esophageal clearance, or to improve esophageal motility?\n\nI\'ve read that warm water helps, so I\'ve started drinking warm water with meals and after, and it has indeed helped. \n\nUnfortunately, I\'ve also read that impaired motility is more associated with not just the development of Barrett\'s, but with dysplastic changes. I realize the odds are low, especially given my length of Barrett\'s, but to say that this is like a dark cloud hanging over me would be an understatement. \n\nSo while I\'ve been told \"there\'s nothing we can do\", I refuse to accept that.
