          <li>Take your medication 30-45 minutes before breakfast</li>
          <li>If you are taking your medication in the evening, take it 30-45 minutes before your evening meal</li>
          <li>Take your medication every day at the same time</li>
          <li>Don&#39;t skip days on medication until you consume all the given pills</li>
          <li>Don't take higher dosages or more pills a day if you haven't consulted your doctor previously</li>
          <li>Avoid drinking alcohol, sodas, avoid smoking and anything else which could extend the healing process</li>
          <li>Consume less acidic foods</li>
          <li>Eliminate trigger foods</li>
          <li>Do moderate exercise and drink water</li>
          <li>If your PPI brand causes you side effects then try another one until you find the "perfect" one for you (minimal or no side effects)</li>
          <li>
            Use the minimal effective dosage. For example, if you are using omeprazole 20 mg and if that dosages keeps your symptoms at bay, then stay on it, no need for
            increasing your dosage unless your situation worsens.
